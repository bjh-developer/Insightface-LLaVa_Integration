# How to run the Insightface-LLaVa integration programme:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Using the web scraper, scrap news articles.
3. The scraped images will be downloaded into a folder called "full".
4. Run the main.py code while ensuring that the file path in the main.py has been updated to point to where the "full" folder is.
